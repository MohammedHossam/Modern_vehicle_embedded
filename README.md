# Modern_vehicle_embedded
  Modern day vehicles come with various safety and entertainment features to make our lives better. However, safety features are considered more important than entertainment features, consequently they have higher priorities when it comes to execution. In this project, we are going to implement some of these features using an Arduino (Mega) board, giving each feature a suitable priority. Arduino C alongside FreeRTOS will be used to implement the project.

# Car Features :

# 1) Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)
   a) Alerts a driver to an imminent crash with audible warnings.
   b) It will independently brake and stop the car.

# 2)Warning Indicators and Power Mirrors
   The dashboard displays the following information in REAL-TIME on an LCD Display:
   a) Rain Detection.
   b) Low Level Fuel Detection.
   c) Seat-Belt Detection with Audible Warning.
   d) Adjustable Mirrors in two directions.
   
# 3)Keyless Entry
   a) Lock and Unlock your car without a physical key.
   b) Start/Stop Engine button.
